## 🧭 Usage Guide

1. Follow the directory order — start from **Business Planning (01)** and move through to **Advanced Architecture (07)**.  
2. Use the templates in **08-Templates-and-References** to maintain consistency.  
3. Each `` file serves as a living document — update them during each development phase.  
4. Store diagrams (PNG/DRAWIO) under their respective subfolders.
